    <h1>Resume API</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Resume API is a Ruby on Rails app that serves up my resume and portfolio. It is an "API Mode" app providing both RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Model</h2>
    <p>
    Data is stored in Postgres and modeled via ActiveRecord. The primary model is the Resume model, which contains name, personal info and summary. A Resume has many Jobs (as work_history), many Startups (as startup_experience), many CommunityEfforts, many Skillsets, and many educations (as education).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Project model holds information about projects making up my portfolio.
    </p>
    <h2>Endpoints</h2>
    The following requests are supported:
    (All endpoints should be prepended with host and `/api/v1`)

    <h4>GET /resume(.:format)</h4>
    Returns the resume in the optionally-specified format (.json or .pdf). JSON is the default format

    <h4>GET /resume/view</h4>
    Returns the resume as a PDF document, rendered in the browser.

    <h4>GET /projects(:format)</h4>
    Returns the collection of projects

    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    The Resume API Rails application is deployed on Heroku within a Docker container, providing dev-prod parity and one-step deployment to production. The Postgres database URL is configured via a single environment variable which may point to any container or service.
